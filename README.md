# Marmot theme for NeoVim

Based on wombat256mod and the iTerm 2 Wombat colors, via the original [Wombat Lush port by ViViDboarder](https://github.com/ViViDboarder/wombat.nvim). Using this as a starting point for my [similarly named customizations](https://studiostyl.es/schemes/marmot) of Wombat for Visual Studio.

Created with [Lush](http://git.io/lush.nvim)

## Installation with Packer

    use {
        "mattrudder/marmot.nvim",
        requires = "rktjmp/lush.nvim",
    }
